The following are the differences between vector and array −
Vector is a sequential container to store elements and not index based.
Array stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type and it is index based.
Vector is dynamic in nature so, size increases with insertion of elements.
As array is fixed size, once initialized can’t be resized.
Vector occupies more memory.
Array is memory efficient data structure.
Vector takes more time in accessing elements.
Array access elements in constant time irrespective of their location as elements are arranged in a contiguous memory allocation.

    Vector	                                                                         List

It has contiguous memory.	                                              While it has non-contiguous memory.

It is synchronized.                                                     While it is not synchronized.

Vector may have a default size.	                                        List does not have default size.

In vector, each element only requires the space for itself only.	      In list, each element requires extra space for the node which holds the element, 
                                                                        including pointers to the next and previous elements in the list.
                                                                        
Insertion at the end requires constant time but                         Insertion is cheap no matter where in the list it occurs.
insertion elsewhere is costly.	                                  

Deletion at the end of the vector needs constant time but               Deletion is cheap no matter where in the list it occurs.
for the rest it is O(n).
Random access of elements is possible.	                                Random access of elements is not possible.
